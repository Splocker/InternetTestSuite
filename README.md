# InternetTestSuite
This project is the result of frustration with my ISP. The purpose is to make me aware of issues shortly after the occur and to
actually track the data so that if issues arise, they can be confidently presented to ISP's or the FCC with data to back them up.
The program will use pings to test connection status and speedtests to check connection quality. The data will be recorded in CSV
files and and emails with data summaries will be sent regularally, email schedule will be defined in the config file.

Required non-standard libraries:
- speedtest
- pythonping

Planned Feature List:
- Config file
- Ping capability
- Speedtest capability
- Logging
- Email composition
- CSV file handling
